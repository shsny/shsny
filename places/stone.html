<h3>
Movie Night<br>
Thursday, June 14, 6:30 - 8:00pm<br>
<br>
Part 3 of Jonathan Miller's <em>Atheism</em><br>
Plus<br>
<em>Bedazzled</em>
</h3>

Our first-ever SHSNY Movie Night April 23 was a solid success,
attracting two dozen happy diners, drinkers and viewers for Parts 1
and 2 of <em>Atheism: A History of Disbelief</em> &ndash; and we'll
conclude our viewing Monday night.

<p/> 

Then we'll view <em>Bedazzled</em>, the 1967 very funny British take
on the Faust legend, starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, and a
stunning young Raquel Welch as <em>Lust</em>.

<p/> 

There's no room-rental charge at the Stone Creek Lounge, but bar
management expects us each to spend the equivalent of a "one drink
minimum."  A few bucks in the SHSNY kitty would be nice (but not
obligatory), too.  Check out the food menu and prices (lots of
inexpensive "bar platter" choices) at
