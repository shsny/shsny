<h1>Secular Humanist Society of New York</h1>

<em>Humanism</em> is the philosophy of life guided by reason and
science, freed from religious and secular dogmas, motivated by an
appreciation of life and the lives of others, seeking to reach goals
of human happiness, freedom and understanding on this earth, in this
life.

<p/>

SHSNY is an Affiliated Local Group of the Council for Secular
Humanism, and a Charter Chapter of the American Humanist Association.

<h2>SHSNY Day of Reason Celebration Brunch/Lecture/Discussion</h2>

with guest speaker Tom Flynn, Executive Director, Council for Secular
Humanism, and Editor, Free Inquiry Magazine, on "Who Are These
Doubters, Anyway? The Demography Of Unbelief"

<p/>

We've seen the various religion polls and the reported percentages of
unbelievers â€“ and the polls vary widely. Which surveys are reliable?
In an illustrated presentation Tom Flynn explores how sociologists and
pollsters have measured religious belief and unbelief from the
mid-twentieth century to today. What do polls on religion really mean
(e.g., how many "no religious preference" people are really
atheists?).

<p/>

Proclaim and celebrate the National Day of Reason (not prayer) at
historic Pete's Tavern, enjoy a sumptuous (and reasonable) brunch, and
get involved with a fascinating talk.

<p/>

Brunch is $25 for your choice of 11 entrees, one drink (Bloody Mary,
Mimosa, etc.), coffee or tea, including all taxes and tips.

<p/>

The room only holds 50, and this event will be a sellout!

<p/>
